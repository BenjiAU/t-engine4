return [[During your adventures in the world you will find items.
You can only carry a certain amount of items, depending on your Strength: this is your maximum encumberance.
You can see your inventory by pressing 'i' or by right-clicking on yourself.
You can pickup items from the ground by pressing ',' or right clicking on yourself while you are over items.

Your inventory is split in two zones: your equipped items and your backpack.

Now pickup the infusion you have found. Infusions and Runes are special items that allow you to bind a power on your own body.
Infusions come from the powers of nature while runes from the powers of magic.
Simply use the infusion from your inventory, it will inscribe your skin and allow you to regenerate your life at will.
You can only have a finite number of inscriptions on your body, but they can easily be replaced.
Then move on to the west.
