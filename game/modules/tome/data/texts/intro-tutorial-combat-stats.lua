#LIGHT_GREEN#Welcome to ToME 4!#LAST#

For testing purposes, this tutorial is temporarily replacing the usual tutorial. For the release, both tutorials will be available from the birther interface.

It is intended as a showcase for some new changes to the way combat stats work. At the end of the tutorial, you'll find directions pointing you to a document that details what exactly has been changed, and why. Constructive feedback is greatly appreciated!

Onward! The #GOLD#Dungeon of Adventurer Enlightenment#WHITE# awaits you!
