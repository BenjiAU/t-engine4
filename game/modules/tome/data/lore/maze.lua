Lessons are off this week as my tutor has fallen ill, so I've decided to sneak out and have a wander round the old mazed ruins nearby. I know I'll get in trouble if I'm caught, but as long as I'm back in a couple of days no one will notice... Besides, I get so bored cooped up in those mountains! I want some fun!

My, what a dirty place this is! I've come across a few bandits and snakes in here, but nothing to threaten a grade 3 mage like me.

I remember hearing that this labyrinth used to be a prison used by the halfling king Roupar during the Age of Dusk, and that with the lawlessness of the time captives were simply sent here to rot. Some say a magical curse infected the place and turned them into bull-like monsters that patrol the halls to this day. How exciting!!]],

Goodness this place is dull to walk round. Left, right, left, right - there's no end to it! I'm soooo bored! I think I might start using Probability Travel... I know my tutors have warned against it in dangerous places, but if I don't do something I'll just die of boredom!]],

I'm having so much fun! Probability Travel is making this little trip a breeze. And you should have seen the look on that bandit's face when I came out one wall, disappeared through another, and came around behind him! Hee hee hee...

I still remember Archmage Tarelion's lecture about the spell - "Probability effects can be used for ease of use, but beware thee of relying on them. With ease of use comes ease of mind and a weakening of one's will and concentration. Soon one will find oneself in a situation of risk, and bereft of normal judgement of danger. Heed thee well." Bah, what tosh!!! How dumb does he really think I am?! Besides, I'm enjoying myself - I'm having an adventure!!]],

Um, I had a bit of a near miss there. Silly of me really - I walked through a wall and saw some bandits and started blasting them, but I didn't notice some of their friends behind me. Luckily his first stab only grazed me, and I got away before he tried a second. Oh well, I'm sure it won't happen again...]],

I saw something! I don't know what it was... but it was big and shadowy! But when I tried chasing it I got lost... Um, maybe I just imagined it? No, I'm sure it must be something cool and exciting, I just have to keep exploring!]],
