description = [[
Morgoth is banned to the Void. Sauron has been vanquished, the #ff0000#One Ring#ffffff# destroyed.
The nations of Men, Dwarves, Elves and Hobbits are freed from the tyranny of the Rings.

For over one hundred twenty years, peace prevailed in the West under the
rule of the High King of the Reunited Kingdom, #14fffc#Aragorn II Elessar#ffffff# and his wife #14fffc#Arwen Evenstar#ffffff#.
The High King died of old age two years ago, and his son, #14fffc#Eldarion#ffffff#, is now king.

#14fffc#Elrond and Galadriel#ffffff#, the great leaders of the Elves, left Middle-earth for Valinor.
But many elves still dwell in Middle-earth, for some of them love this land for which they fought so hard.

In the the Lonely Mountain, the dwarves prosper along with their human allies of Dale
under the guidance of #14fffc#Thorin III Stonehelm#ffffff#, the King under the Mountain.

In the Shire, life is... as usual, simple and full of joy and pipeweed! If such thing as ruling exists for Hobbits, then it is #14fffc#Thain Faramir I and Mayor Tolman Gardner#ffffff# that should handle it.

This is a golden age, or at least it should be....

Trouble is brewing in the east. Rumours in Lake-town near the Lonely Mountain have it
that some power is growing in the far east, and Orcs sightings have started to multiply.

However, you do not think this concerns you---for you have set out to discover wonders, explore old places, and venture into the unknown for wealth and glory.
But beware, the eastern troubles could be yours all too soon....
