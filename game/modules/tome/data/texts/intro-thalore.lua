return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You are of the Thaloren, the Elven race closest to nature. Your people have lived for thousands of years in their forest, rarely taking part in the events of the outside world.
Yet when their home is threatened, the Thaloren Elves can prove to be fearsome combatants.
You lived a peaceful life deep in the forest for many years, but lately you have grown restless and have decided to step into the world.

You have decided to venture into the old and wild places looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You have come to the western side of the thaloren forest, to the lair of norgos. Norgos always was an ally of the thaloren, protecting the western border, but as of late he has grown corrupt and started attacking even thaloren.
To the east of Shatur, the thaloren main city, lies a dark part of the wood, ever since the spellblaze this area has grown corrupt, the wildlife there has been transformed.

After days of travel, you have found norgos lair and entered it. What will you find there...?
