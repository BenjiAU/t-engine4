return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#]]..name..[[#WHITE#.
You are an elf, one of the first born. Many of your kind, having grown weary of Middle Earth, have left for the immortal lands.
Yet some elves do not wish to leave this land they fought so hard for. In Mirkwood Forest, now called Eryn Lasgalen, the kingdom of Thranduil still thrives.
You lived a peaceful life deep in the forest for many years but lately you have grown restless and have decided to step into the world.

You have decided to venture into the old and wild places looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You have come to a land called Rhudaur on the western side of the Misty Mountains, far away from your home in search of the ruined tower of Amon Sul. You have heard that the caverns below are infested with vermin and undead.
Close by, to the east are the Trollshaws another dangerous place - an old forest infested with trolls and other dangerous animals.

After days of travel you have found the tower and are about to enter the caves. What will you discover...
