return [[You have found a nest of snakes!
As you fought the previous ones you know they are not very strong individualy but if you let them surround you you might be in trouble!
A basic tactic in ToME4 is to try to never get surrounded, do not hesitate to backtrack a bit to get into a safer spot.
#GOLD#Always control the fight.#WHITE#

Now take a few steps backwards to only have to fight one snake at a time and you should survive. Remember to use your talents and maybe a potion of healing if need be.
