return [[During your adventures in the world you will find items.
You can only carry a certain amount of items, depending on your Strength: this is your maximum encumberance.
You can see your inventory by pressing 'i' or by right-clicking on yourself.
You can pickup items from the ground by pressing ',' or right clicking on yourself while you are over items.

Your inventory is split in two zones: your equiped items and your backpack.

Now pickup the potion you have found and move on to the west.
