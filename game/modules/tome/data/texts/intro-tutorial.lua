#LIGHT_GREEN#Welcome to ToME 4!#LAST#

This tutorial will present you with a short quest to familiarise yourself with the game.
You are a human adventurer sent into the forest by the local village to dispose of the "Lone Wolf".

This tutorial character is more powerful than a normal starting character and has infinite lifes.
A normal character normaly only has one life, once you die, you die (unless you found or accomplished things that allow you to resurrect).

During this tutorial you will be guided by dialog boxes such as this one, explaining you how things work.
Dialog boxes such as this one can be dismissed by either pressing Escape or clicking outside of their zone (or on the title).

Now close this dialog to proceed.
