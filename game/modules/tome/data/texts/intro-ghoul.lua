return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#]]..name..[[#WHITE#.
You have died ages ago, but that did not stop you, you were raised as an undead ghoul.

After wandering aimlessly for eons you found a goal: to become a force to be reckoned with in this world.
You have decided to venture into the old and wild places of the world, looking for ancient treasures and enough power to carve your way in blood through the world!

You have come to a land called Rhudaur, on the western steppes of the Misty Mountains, far away from your home, in search of the Trollshaws. It is an old forest infested with trolls and all kinds of wild animals.
To the east lies another dangerous place: the ruined tower of Amon SÃ»l. You heard the caves below were infested by vermin and undead.

After days of travel, you have found the forest and entered it, what will you find there?...
