	lore = [[I have been given permission to explore the scintillating caves to the east. Normally they are sealed off, but having a father on the council has its uses, even if he is normally a dumb buffoon...

These caves are the site of where the Spellblaze began. An ancient Sher'Tul farportal lay buried here, and our ancestors tapped into that power to their destruction. Many of the greatest Shaloren mages stood here, and when the energies beyond comprehension erupted they were all annihilated instantly. It was a terrible loss to our people - such knowledge and power lost forever!

Now the ancient ruins have become overgrown by crystals. Reports say that they grow each year. Could they be alive..?

I must admit that stepping into the starting place of the Spellblaze fills me with immense trepidation. This was where the great destruction began, that tore through our world, wiping out cities, tearing the world apart. And yet look at the beauty here!
