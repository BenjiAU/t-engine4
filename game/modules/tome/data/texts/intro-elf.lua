return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#]]..name..[[#WHITE#.
You are an elf, the first-born. Many of your kind having gone weary of Middle-earth and left for the immortal lands.
Yet some elves do no wish to leave this land they fought so hard for. In the Mirkwood forest, now called Eryn Lasgalen, the kingdom of Thranduil still thrives.
You lived a peaceful life deep in the forest for many hundred years but lately you have grown restless and decided to step into the world.

You have decided to venture into the old and wild places of the world, looking for treasures of old and glory.

You have come to a land called Rhudaur, on the western steppes of the Misty Mountains, far away from your home, in search of the ruined tower of Amon SÃ»l. You heard the caves below were infested by vermin and undeads.
Nearby to the east also lies the Trollshaws and other dangerous place, an old forest infested with trolls and all kinds of wild animals.

After days of travels you have found the ruined tower and entered the caves, what will you find there...
