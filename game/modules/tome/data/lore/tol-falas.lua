Skeletons, you have been getting noticeably behind in your adventurer slaughtering quotas. The next skeleton archer I see drinking coffee and chatting with the wights shall be rent limb from limb and fed to the orcs. Also, as a punishment for your general laxness, 1,000 skeletons shall be remanded down to Kor'Pul as punishment. A further 250 shall be slaughtered. These orders to be carried out by myself tomorrow at 3am.]],

All hail your brilliant Master. Would you like to walk in the sun? Would you like to be free to roam green meadows and crush innocent children? Such are my wishes also. The reward to anyone who brings me any item that will help me bend this sta... item to my will shall be stupendous.

Also, any new minions who have magical research skills are wanted. Recruit them and you shall be rewarded. Though if they steal my secrets, your blood will be my wine and your heart my appetizer.]],

I began my long unlife as a foolish pipsqueak such as yourself. Why, there was a time before I had conquered even a pit let alone a level or a dungeon. Now, behold all that is Mine.

You must have aspirations. I am not content with just the rule of Dreadfell. No, soon I shall have more. Much more. My boots shall tread the surface of the earth! I shall explore and destroy the most beautiful mountains. All shall be mine once I can walk in the sun once more. Where will you be? Do you wish to be more than the wight I stepped on yesterday? I shall need great leaders to guide my armies across the land.]],

However, he was great and had the chance to be greater still. He let himself be cooped into a small hellhole and was destroyed when the right hero invaded it and destroyed his plaything. Now he is but a mere shade of his former glory.

I shall not make this mistake. Be ready, for soon we shall march out upon the lands. Soon we shall conquer as even he could not. Pity the fool who thinks he can keep me stuck in even the grandest of pits, Dreadfell.]],

To the rest of you, there will be punishment. An adventurer got down to my bedroom and surprised me. I, Myself, was hurt and almost had to use My special power. All is well now and I am as dangerous as ever, but you shall suffer for letting him get so low. The next minion I see shall be toasted with my marshmallows. Where then were the special pits of doom I organized? Where were the poisons of my wights or the diseases of my ghouls? Indeed, I should slaughter all of you, and I would, but those who were most foully remiss were already slaughtered by the adventurer. The rest of you? Beware My wrath.]],

Every great leader needs tales penned of his brilliant conquest. Therefore I now command you all to write more poetry in my honour, praising my amazing powers, unrivalled leadership, unconquerable strength, etc etc. Any that fail to produce works of sufficient standard shall be annihilated.]],
