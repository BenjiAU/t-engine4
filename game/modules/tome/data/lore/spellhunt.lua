From an objective viewpoint, you would think the Spellhunt futile, but it was not so. You couldn't imagine the barbarism of the magehunting mobs; they would abuse and persecute any they saw as eccentric, many of whom had no connection to magic at all.
...
True mages would sometimes speak up in an act of altruism, just to stop the suffering of the innocent, but this only fuelled the horde's anger...
...
Other mages, those less forgiving and more given to action, would attack the roving mobs, but they soon learnt that against sufficent numbers magic is not omnipotent...
...
Ones I saw were set upon by dozens, their conjured flames and bolts of energy failing against the maddened crowds... they would often literally rip the mage limb from limb. It was horrific.
...
Angolwen, Linaniil calls it. I have known Linaniil for many years, and I know she has lost many loved ones to the Spellhunt, but she still holds true to her belief that one day we will be accepted once again. If this is the course of action she desires, I will follow her without question.]],
