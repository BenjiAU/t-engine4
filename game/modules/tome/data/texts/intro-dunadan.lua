return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#]]..name..[[#WHITE#.
You are a Dúnedain, one of the last descendants of the proud men of Númenor.
Hailing from a great line of greater men you have decided to prove your worth by venturing into the old and wild places of the world, looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You have come to a northern land called Rhudaur, on the western steppes of the Misty Mountains in search of the ruined tower of Amon Sûl. You heard the caves below were infested by vermin and undead.
To the east lies another dangerous place: the Trollshaws. It is an old forest infested with trolls and all kinds of wild animals.

After days of travels you have found the ruined tower and entered the caves, what will you find there...
