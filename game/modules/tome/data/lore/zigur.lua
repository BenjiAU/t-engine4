	lore = [[1. You will not talk about Zigur to the wider world, lest evil ears be listening.
2. You will shun the use of all spells and witchcraft.
3. You will shun the use of magic-cursed wands.
4. You will shun the baneful influence of arcane runes and burn any skin that comes in contact with them.
5. You will not aid or abet any you suspect of wizardry or conjuration.
6. You will take note of any you suspect of spellweaving and report their name and address to the elders.
7. You will actively hunt down and bring suffering upon any you suspect of using magic, communing with spirits, demon worship, or any you suspect of aiding others in these acts.
8. You will report to the elders all activity you deem suspicious, especially evidence of cults or secret societies.

These are the rules we live by, these are the rules by which we will save our world. All who fail in these rules will be purged with flame.]],
