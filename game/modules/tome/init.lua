description = [[
Morgoth is banned in the Void, Sauron has been vanquished, the One Ring destroyed.
The nations of Men, Dwarves, Elves and Hobbits are freed from the tyranny of the Rings.
This is a golden age, or at least it should be...
Trouble is brewing in the east. Rumours in Lake-town near the Lonely Mountain have it
that some power is growing in the far east, orc have started to multiply in sigthings.

However you do not think this concerns you, you set out to discover the old, explore
old places, venture into the unknown for wealth and glory.
But beware, the eastern troubles could be yours all too soon...
