game.player:forceLevelup(2)

return [[In ToME4 a character power depends on her/his level: players can get up to level 50.
Each level brings some more amount of life and ressources (like stamina, mana, ...) and different kind of points that can be used to improve your character in various ways:
* #GOLD#Stat points#WHITE#: They allow you to raise the six main stats: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Willpower, Cunning and Constitution. You get 3 points per levels.
* #GOLD#Class talent points#WHITE#: They allow you to improve a class talent (denoted as such in the talent interface). Class talents define the core functions of your class. You get 1 point per level except every 5 levels where you gain 2.
* #GOLD#Generic talent points#WHITE#: They allow you to improve a generic talent (denoted as such in the talent interface). Generic talents provide utility/more power but are not always specific to your class. You get 1 point per level except every 5 levels where you gain 0.
* #GOLD#Category talent points#WHITE#: They allow you to improve your mastery of a talent category (thus improving the power of all talents inside) or to learn a new talent category.

Levels are gained by accumulating experience, the most classic form of experience gain is to kill an hostile creature whose level is not too low compared to yours.

To get to the character levelup screen either press 'G' or right-click on yourself.

Now open the levelup screen and assign your points.
