return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Tempest",
[[
Magic has not disappeared from Middle-earth with the downfall of Sauron and the departing of Gandalf the Grey.

Before the war of the ring, Gandalf, fearing that he might die leaving his task incomplete, started a secret plan with a group of trusted elves and men to form a place of knowledge, hidden from all.
This place is Angolwen, the City of Magic, and for over one hundred years has taught magic to preserve and expand it.

You have uncovered the secrets of the storm magic and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Tempest class#WHITE#.

Tempests are specialized archmages, attuned to the magical properties of lightning.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Cast potent lightning spells to zap your foes to death.
- Unleash hurricanes and novas on your foes, making them all explode.
- Learn to master the Tempest, a lightning so powerful it can damage even those resistant to normal lightning.
- Manipulate the forces of magic themselves#WHITE#

All mages use mana to cast their spells.
It slowly replenishes over time.
