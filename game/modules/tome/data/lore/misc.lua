Though armies would fall before the Spellblaze's might, though forests were razed and the skies bled red with fire, they always felt that the earth would endure. It seemed eternal, unmoving. Not even the fury of the Spellblaze could hope to destroy it.

How wrong they were. The Nalorën people, long secluded, were prepared to fend off any attacks on their land, but how could they hope to stop the land itself crumbling? Seeing their home literally tearing itself apart, plains and forests tumbling into the seas... For one brief, terrible moment, they beheld the true extent of the Spellblaze's power. Not only was it destroying the people of the world, but the world itself.

The lands of the Narlorën had sunk beneath the waves.]],

For the years following the cataclysm, chaos reigned. Their culture, their way of life, it was as broken and fractured as the land itself. Nalorë civilisation was reduced to a few isolated and feeble settlements, scratching out meagre existences as land, mind and body was warped in both shape and spirit.

Faced with the idea of their great race failing – another victim of the Spellblaze, a footnote in the annals of history – impassioned pleas were sent to their elven brothers: The Shalorën, the Thalorën. Aid was even requested from human and halfling, embroiled in their own petty squabbles as they were.

The Nalorën received no answer.]],

Betrayed by the Shalorën, wilful and destructive, and the Thalorën, aloof and suspicious, a long, seething silence fell over the remaining Nalorën people. It was during this period of grim introspection that salvation was suddenly and unexpectedly granted. The ancient Sher'Tul magicks, long pondered over by the land's mystics, would bear fruit at last.

The same force that destroyed the Nalorën would save them. Through the Sher'Tul's magic, the Nalorën became able to breathe water as if it was air. Their bodies became adapted for existence under the waves, their legs becoming long, snake-like tails. Such drastic metamorphosis would naturally cause horror, you may expect. However, the Nalorën saw the possibilities their new forms provided: Their sunken lands were their own once again. Their homes would be rebuilt, their civilisation reborn. Nalorën no more, the denizens of the sunken kingdom would come to be known as 'nagas'...]],

Lithe in form, faultless in combat, unmatched in speed both above the waves and beneath... nature couldn't have hoped to create such a race as nagas. With the Temple of Creation now open to me however, we may become so much more. With my guidance, my careful shaping of the Sher'Tul's magicks, under my expert hand our great race shall soon reach its zenith. A new tract shall soon be written: The Tract of the Devourer.
