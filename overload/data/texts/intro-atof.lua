return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.

For many years, you lived in a peaceful little village near the forest. You kept the townsfolk safe from intruding wildlife and cattle thieves, but overall your life was a quiet one.

Today, you woke up to find your home town empty and ruined, as if it had been destroyed many decades ago. Only a few crumbling walls remain of the houses and cottages you and your friends lived in. And from the adjacent forest, you occasionally hear the crackling of magical energies.

You gather your equipment and set out to track down the cause of this phenomenon. What will you find?
