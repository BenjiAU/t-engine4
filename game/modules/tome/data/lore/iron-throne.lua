#{bold}#4362: #{normal}#Grand Smith Dakhtun has discovered new methods of infusing magical effects in weapons and armour. Potential for profit growth in this area very high.
#{bold}#4550: #{normal}#First special meeting of Iron Throne Profits Committee. War with humans and halflings worrying, as it is reducing potential market size. Threat of complete market elimination forces us to drastic action - all weapons trade must cease. Increase stockpiles of construction materials in hope of eventual reconciliation.
#{bold}#5967: #{normal}#Shaloren involvement in war is becoming too grave a risk - legends of Sher'Tul destruction are a pertinent reminder of the dangers of high magic. Increasing investment in new Ziguranth order in hopes of opposing this problem.
#{bold}#6550: #{normal}#War ended. Opportunity presents itself - now reopening trade, with high prices on all construction items. Profits forecast is very high.
#{bold}#6827: #{normal}#Killed Kroltar the Crimson Wyrm and recovered his hoard. Value of hoard: 2 million gold. Resources lost in recovery effort: 700,000 gold (estimation based on standard assessment of 350 gold per capita lost). Net profit: 1.3 million gold. Profit margin is 186%!
#{bold}#6980: #{normal}#Resources based on dragon hoards are dwindling. Must reduce cull targets to allow recovery of numbers.
#{bold}#7420: #{normal}#Major orc attacks are ruining trade arrangements. Cutting off all contracts until markets settle.
#{bold}#7494: #{normal}#Disastrous use of magic by Shaloren elves has had an unprecedented impact on profitability of our operations. Increasing protectionist measures to prevent economic ruin.]],

Relations with Toknor of the humans are seen to be especially important - have sent him some of our best armour and weapons to ensure a good return on our investments. In hindsight we should have charged more for these.
