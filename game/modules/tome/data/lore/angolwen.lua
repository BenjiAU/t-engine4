	lore = [[It were some years now since twain of our brightest students left Angwolen, sullied by our veil of secrecy and our silent duty. It still lies heavy on mine heart to think of what they could accomplish inwith our private circle. I but hope that one day they wilst return, and they wilst understand the reasons behind our solemn mission.

But I must think of the future, for too many are the regrets of mine long past, and to hold their burdens overlong is to be crushed. I must think of ye, young acolytes, who start now in the learning of our lores. I must explain to ye our mission, our purpose, our justification, so that ye understand all what we do and why. In secrecy we operate, trying to heal the harms of our past, trying to build a better future. For our penance is great, and never should it be forgotten in all Eyal the terrors of the Spellblaze.

I should know well, for I were there. But a young mage was I, though not without promise. I knew of the Shaloren mages' experiments on the Sher'Tul ruins. Aye, and I were jealous of the powers they sought to unlock. No fear or caution had I in my arrogant youth, thinking only of opportunities and glory. Heed well that thought...

Two thousand six hundred cycles of the Sun have passed above my head, and yet still I cannot shake the memory of the day the sky turned to flame and the earth was torn to shreds. I felt the magic in the air, the sudden unleashing of arcane energies beyond anyone's control. I knew in an instant that the Shaloren had unlocked the power of the farportals, but the forces were far beyond their expectations. I saw within seconds the streams of blazing energy tear through the sky above our heads, and then rain down in crimson plumes of destruction. It was all I could to put a shield about myself, and the burns I suffered were terrible, such that scars remain to this day. No one about me survived. Still I remember mine sister Nienna's shortened scream as she stood beside me, her skin flayed off by the terrible energies, her body consumed by a pyre of flames, her ashes strewn by a great tumult in the earth. Twenty-six centuries have passed and still I do wake to the sound of that scream...

Many were the loved ones I lost that day, and I were not alone. Countless perished across the lands, and countless more died in the chaos which followed. Then the Spellhunt began, and the people rose against the arrogance of the mages and began slaughtering us mercilessly. After the Spellblaze our abilities were in disarray, our mana channels sundered. We were nigh defenceless, and it took great effort to gather many of us together and found the hidden city of Angwolen. A great many mages were killed in the riots that followed, aye and many innocents too, for distrust was rife and the thirst for blood all-consuming. But alas, the suffering did not end there.

The effects of the Spellblaze can still be seen today, in tortured lands and blighted earths. In the Age of Dusk it were much worse. New diseases arose, plagues swept across all cities, civilisations brought to nothing. All our races came close to extinction, and an age of darkness came upon all learning and enlightenment. Feudal lords and bandit gangs fought amongst what little healthy lands were left, whilst the blights continued to ravage what free people remained. That was when I did begin our secret missions to repair the world, to make right the errors of our actions. In silent operation we visited the broken lands and used our powers to heal, not to destroy. Many centuries it took, but at last the aftereffects of the Spellblaze began to diminish, and the people began to rebuild.

Ah, how much hope was in me then. But foolish were I to think it could be so easy. The wounds of Eyal struck deeper than mere diseases on the surface. The poison went down much further, and the cracks tore through the very roots of our world. One dark and stormy day a great cataclysm swept forth from the east, and the land rose 500 leagues into the sky. We could do naught but gasp in horror as whole cities, whole races were swept into the sea. The continents were sheared apart and all of Eyal forever changed. It was a sight to humble even the greatest archmage.

Aye, and humility is what I teach to ye now. Know ye well that there are forces out there which dwarf ye into insignificance. Know as well that they have no glory, no pride, for they are forces of ultimate destruction which bring only terror and pain.

Our mission is to help the world. Our penance is to act in secret. Old wounds remain and new threats do arise, but all must be dealt with from behind our cloak of silence. The mistrust of our ilk still lies deep in people's minds, and there are even those who hate us with a violent passion. But the world is changing, and perhaps one day we shall be accepted again in society. Until then remember well this lesson of humility, and in the open world keep ye secret, and keep ye safe.]],
