In the uttermost east, on the continent known only as the Far East, dwells the last remnants of elves and humans, fighting the Orc Pride and the many perils of the Far East.

Anorithil are elven mages who are trained in special magic to manipulate the Sun and Moon powers.
They have learned to harness the powers of both shadows and light in their battle against the Pride.
Their motto is: "I am Grey. I stand between the candle and the star. We are Grey. We stand between the darkness and the light."

You have helped one of them and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Anorithil class#WHITE#.
