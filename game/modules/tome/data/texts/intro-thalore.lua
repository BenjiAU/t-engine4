return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You are an Thaloren elf, the elven race closest to nature. Your people have lived for thousands of years in their forest, rarely taking part in the events of the outside world.
Yet when their home is threatened the Thaloren elves can prove to be fearsome combatants.
You lived a peaceful life deep in the forest for many years, but lately you have grown restless and have decided to step into the world.

You have decided to venture into the old and wild places looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You have come to a land called the derthfields on the western border of the Thaloran forest, in search of the Trollshaws. It is an old forest infested with trolls and all kinds of wild animals.
To the east lies another dangerous place: the old ruins of Kor'Pul. You heard the caves below were infested by vermin and undead.

After days of travel, you have found the forest and entered it, what will you find there?...
