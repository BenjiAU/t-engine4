	lore = [[Loremaster Verutir here. I have been assigned to write an official chronicle of the history of the Sunwall. This will be my notebook as I interview people and travel from place to place. If you are reading this, you are either my patron (thanks again, sir!) a sneak (get out of my journal!) or the finder of my corpse. If the last, please take this to Lord Forosyth of the town of the Sunwall for a reward, tell my wife how I died, and tell the kids that I love them.
With that said I shall be starting this project by investigating the elves and their connection to the Sunwall. They should be one of the easier races to interview considering their life expectancy and their penchant for remembering their own history. Of course, there aren't as many of them around as there used to be And that's the thing: most of the elves left for Valinor, so the elves we might see around here are all Avari.
...
Unfortunately though, our local elves are also unwilling to talk to me about their history. However, there is a fellow Thanchir who I hear would be happy to help. The only problem is that he lies on the other side of a huge encampment of orcs, so I will need an escort to help me. We will see how that goes. I have heard things about those adventurer escorts ...]],

	lore = [[And boy were all the rumors about unreliable adventurers true. I'd heard that many, many escorted people die when their adventurer flees and protects himself. It is TRUE. Once I got an escort, I headed off in the right direction immediately. However, for some reason, he did not immediately follow, let alone lead. Didn't he know the way to go? Foolish man. Why am I offering my special trainings to someone who doesn't even know where the local portals are! Fortunately I survived, but no thanks to him. I won't even mention his snoring...
This Thanchir guy really really needs to find a more urban spot with accessible public transportation (no adventurers please!) However, once I could get him to talk, he does know quite a bit. Apparently, he claims some distant kinship to the first elf in these parts. They arrived by boat from some legendary land called \u201cMiddle Earth.\u201d He says that it definitely exists, but could provide no real evidence. This should be investigated further]],
