return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#]]..name..[[#WHITE#.
You are a native of the town of Bree, a multicultural town that both men and hobbits call home.
Humans are the most common race of the land, and you are part of them. In an attempt to prove your worth you have decided to venture into the old and wild places of the world, looking for treasures of old and glory.

You have come to a land called Rhudaur, just east of Bree, in search of the ruined tower of Amon SÃ»l. You heard the caves below were infested by vermin and undeads.
Nearby to the east also lies the Trollshaws and other dangerous place, an old forest infested with trolls and all kinds of wild animals.

After days of travels you have found the ruined tower and entered the caves, what will you find there...
