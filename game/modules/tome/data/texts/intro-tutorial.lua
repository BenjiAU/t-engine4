#LIGHT_GREEN#Welcome to ToME 4!#LAST#

This tutorial will present you with a short quest to familiarise yourself with the game.
You are a human adventurer, able in both melee combat and spell casting, sent into the forest by the local village to dispose of the "Lone Wolf".

The basic form of attack is a melee blow, to do it simply move toward your target, if it is hostile you will attack it.
You also posses special talents that allow you to perform more powerful attacks, buffs, escapes, ...

Talents are classified into three kinds:
- Active: those are activable actions, like throwing a fireball or stunning a monster with your shield
- Sustained: those are toggled on/off, ususaly reducing your corresponding ressource as long as they are active
- Passive: those are always 'on' and always provide their benefit

** Your starting active talents:
- Shield Pummel: You bash your foe with a powerful shield bash, damaging and stunning it
- Flame: Throw a bolt of flames at your target, burning it for a few turns
- Lightning: A jolt of electricity fires from your fingers in straigth line to your target

** Your starting sustained talents:
- Shield Wall: You take cover behind your shield, improving your defence and armour but reducing your melee offensive power
- Arcane Power: You summon a nexus of magic around you, improving your spell power

** Your starting passive talents:
- Weapon Combat: Improves your chance to hit with your melee weapon
- Heavy Armour Training: Allows you to wear heavy armour and improves your armour rating with them
