	lore = [[Treachery! During a patrol around the outskirts of the High Peak I witnessed two orcs - the envoys from our supposed "master" - talking in secret. Remaining to watch them, I beheld as their orcish features sloughed from their bodies, revealing a pair of human wizards! Humans! To think that our great pride has been decieved in such a manner! I should have crushed their skulls there and then. However, mages can be crafty, so I left them to their scheming.

Even now the blood runs hot! What would Garkul, our mighty berserker king, think if he saw our great race bending before humans?! Many times I have entertained the idea of taking a group of my finest warriors and ending this folly, but... loathsome as it is, I must use tact. A rebellion would leave my pride weakened, easy prey. That bone-picker Rak'Shor and his unnatural creations have dreamed of my death (and subsequent dominion) for years, I know this to be true. This conundrum frustrates and confuses! ... At least we are agreed on one matter - the total destruction of those sun-worshipping dogs of the Gates of Morning...]],

	lore = [[The eyes of the dead bring interesting news to me. Our masters are not what they appear; they are human, simply masquerading as orcs in our presence. I might have suspected this... it is difficult to disguise the basic weakness and frailty of a human soul, even with complex spells. Their goals elude me, yet I sense strange energies in the vicinity of the High Peak - the voices of spirits long departed from this world... some not from this world at all.

But this is foolishness compared to my current trials. Gorbat remains as obstinate as ever, the dragon-loving, scale-shining buffoon. He thinks that dragons are special, different, not suitable for my craft. I care not for his prattling, I desire the corpses of dragons! Mountains of them! How can his heart not beat a little faster at the prospect of a dracozombie?! The mere thought of it is enough to send delightful shivers down my spine...]],

newLore{
	id = "gorbat-pride-note",

	name = "Gorbat's Note",
	lore = [[My dragons bring news. They witnessed humans upon the High Peak, speaking of their mastery over our prides. They did not heed my dragons, unwitting of their ability to communicate with me. Now I possess this information, I must think deeply on how to proceed regarding our "masters". Many of my finest wyrmics wish to rise up against our deceivers, see them consumed in wyrmfire. Even some of my dragons have divulged this wish to me. Sadly, this must wait.

Vor's insolence will be tolerated no longer! His claims that his pride's mastery over the elements surpasses that of the dragons is insult enough, but this...! Some of my finest dragons, my glorious multi-hued wyrms, have been captured and held within their armouries in the hopes that they can further their twisted mockeries of fire and ice! This will not stand! I must ignore the plots of our human deceivers for the moment, for Vor requires my full attention.]],

	lore = [[Strange lights play atop the High Peak. Torches? Nay. The fire of dragons? Not so. A volcanic eruption, perchance? Alas, no. It is unmistakably the fire of the arcane, the fire of mages, and seeing as every pyromancer within our pride is under my dominion, I can only assume that these lights come from one not affiliated with us. The lights are fascinating, I wish to study them; they put me in mind of the fires of the Spellblaze, burning so very long ago...

Sadly, such desires are denied to me at this moment. Plans are in motion, and we are scant weeks away from finally crushing the accursed sun paladins and their tin-plated harlot ruler. Even once the Sunwall lies in ruins I must be careful - the horde of sub-orc savages Grushnak calls a pride are ever at my door, claiming we do not follow Garkul's "true path". He is a fool, but dangerous, and I must be vigilant.]],
