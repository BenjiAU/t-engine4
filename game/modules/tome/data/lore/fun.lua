Grab some grub!
When hunger hits,
Me likes to club!

Little halfling,
Furry feet,
Smash his brains,
Tasty meat!

Skinny elf,
Eyes so blue,
Crush his bones,
Make elf stew!

Hairy dwarf,
Smells like dirt,
Cook him long,
Or stomach hurt!

Stupid human,
Has no fear,
Looks surprised,
When me eats his ear!

Club club club,
Grab some grub!
When hunger hits,
Me likes to club!#{normal}#]],

#{italic}#Saved from coffin, casket, urn
Darkness falls, but life returns!
Flesh may fall and bone may burn
But soul remains, for which we yearn

Those we return to life's esteem
We see their hearts, their eyes do gleam
They rave! They kill! They gnash! They scream!
So full of joy! Their greatest dream!

Returning those that we amend
They hurry home, a distant friend
But do they cheer? Do they commend?
They yell! Does rotting flesh offend?

We bring life to lifeless bone
But do they smile? Do they condone?
They sit upon their golden thrones
They shun us, spurn us, make unknown

Fools! Sit high in golden tower
From your lofty perch you glower
Time will come when you will cower
We rule death, we wield the power
