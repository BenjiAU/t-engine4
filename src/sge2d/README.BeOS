The BeOS system requires the LibPack developer package installed, which
you can get from:

http://www.bebits.com/app/3322

To deliver your application, copy the *.so files from the beos directory
either to the directory your binary is residing, or to /boot/home/config/lib

sge2d should work on Haiku too, but is untested. Please report the result
if you have tried it.
