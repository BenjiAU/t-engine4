return [[Melee attacks are very easy to do, you simply move in the direction of your foe and if it is hostile you will attack it.
If it is not hostile you will either talk to it or switch places with it.

Attacks thus work just like movement, using the keyboard or the mouse.
Melee combat depends on various stats:
* #GOLD#Attack#WHITE#: Your chance to hit
* #GOLD#Defense#WHITE#: Your chance to avoid attacks
* #GOLD#Armour#WHITE#: Flat reduction to damage done
* #GOLD#Damage#WHITE#: You much damage you do per blow
* #GOLD#Armour Penetration#WHITE#: How much of the target's armour you can ignore

You can see those stats, along many others, in the character sheet.
Either press 'C' or right-click on your character to see the character sheet.

You have spotted some hostile jellies guarding an item.
Attack them!
